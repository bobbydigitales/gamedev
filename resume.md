# _How to land your first job as a game developer: the resume_

For a while now, I’ve been offering advice on Twitter to graduates and junior developers applying for their first job in games. I thought I’d summarize the main things I see when helping them.
For some context, I’ve been a game developer for 20 years, and a hiring manager at six different game companies where I estimate I’ve read at least 1000 resumes. Here’s what goes through my head when I’m reviewing resumes, hope you enjoy it :)

## I want to hire you.
As a hiring manager, the best possible outcome for me is that I can hire you. I want you to have an awesome resume, I want you to show me the awesome projects you created, I want to talk to you as soon as possible about it and I want to hire you into the role.

Your resume is the only information I have in order to make a decision, and I have a finite amount of time to review resumes each day, so I need to quickly figure out if I should talk to you on the phone for 40 minutes, or to put your resume to the side and move on to the next person.

## A lot of resumes I review don’t have the information I need.
I see a lot of resumes that have irrelevant information, or just no information at all! If you list a project but don’t say what it was about or don’t say what you did on it specifically, then I have nothing to go on. I’ll sadly put your resume to the side and move on to the next person.

## The five key things to get right.
Let’s take a hypothetical junior gameplay programmer role as an example. When preparing your resume, think about the person who is going to read your resume (me) and what you want to tell them.

The first thing I think when starting to review a resume is, “who is this person, what have they done that’s relevant to this role?” For our junior gameplay role, I’m looking for things you’ve worked on that demonstrate your ability to write good gameplay mechanics and code (these are not necessarily the same thing!).
## 1. Only include things that are relevant to the role you’re applying for
Lots of graduates and junior developers fall at this first hurdle, their resumes are full of things that are just not relevant to the role.
- Worked in a candy store part time? Not relevant.
- Worked in a cafe serving meals? Not relevant.
- Worked on hobby project in your spare time where you implemented some game mechanics? Totally relevant!

When you include something on your resume, you should have a clear idea about why it’s relevant to the role you’re applying to. You might think your part-time job is relevant because it shows responsibility, but I’d much rather see you demonstrate that you successfully worked as part of a team to make a game, as that’s what you’ll be doing in the job :)

## 2. Be crystal-clear about what you did
Once I find the projects that seem relevant to the role I’m hiring for, next I try and figure out what *specifically* you did on that project. If it’s not completely clear, or there are words like “contributed to” or “designed” or “created”, I can’t be sure you actually wrote the code for it and unfortunately I’ll have to pass.
For each thing you list, state specifically what you did, e.g. “I coded the enemy AI for the project which used an A* algorithm for path-finding”. If you want to include non-programming skills, be completely clear about that too, if you designed game systems, or led a team, say specifically what you did.

## 3. Demonstrate your work
If you’re a graduate or junior developer and you don’t have any or many published commercial games you can use to demonstrate your work, playable demos, videos and examples of code are invaluable. Without them, I’m often left thinking that your projects sound cool, but I don’t really know how well they were executed, what the level of polish was, or whether the game mechanics worked nicely etc. You can answer all of these questions by providing a video or playable demo of the game.

For code samples, the best thing is to include a direct link to each project in GitHub. Include a README.md that explains the project and highlights or links to specific examples of code you want me to look at. If you link to an account that has 30 test projects and I can’t quickly figure out what to look at, I’ll have to pass and move on to the next person.

## 4. Your resume needs to tell the whole story; cover letters don’t matter
Covers letters can be passed over, missed or discarded. Your actual resume is the only thing you’re guaranteed that a hiring manager will read. Make sure it tells the whole story of your ability as a gameplay programmer and include all the relevant information directly in your resume.

## 5. Two pages, max three
If your resume is four or more pages long, I’ll just think you struggle to be concise. I’ve been making games for 20 years and my resume is two pages long. I delete things as they become less relevant; games I worked on 19 years ago are not relevant for roles I’m applying for today.


Edit it down, be concise and discard irrelevant information. You should be able to get it into two pages.

If you follow these rules, you’ll end up with a resume that presents your work in the best possible light and you’ll give yourself the best chance of success.

**Good luck!**
